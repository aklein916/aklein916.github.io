          I am a graduate of the
          <a  class ="GA" href='https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive' target='_blank'> Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly</a> in Washington, DC. General Assembly introduced me to a variety of languages and progams, and it is just the beginning of my journey! I appreciate the process needed to succeed as a developer: The simultaneous attention to detail and strategic creativity encourage me to fully immerse myself in projects I am passionate about.
        </br>
          When I am not programming I am outside, exploring my city, spending time with friends and family or, likely, all of the above. I am always up for an adventure, especially one that involves learning something new and connecting with other people. I love stories, and believe that everyone has a unique story to share. I hope that my professional and personal experiences inspire others to find their passions and share them, too.

          Throughout my three and a half years with lululemon athletica I wore many hats. I hired and trained store employees, managed the store's budget, developed strategies to meet ambitious quarterly goals, and planned large-scale community events. As a result, I am excited to jump into new projects, such as marketing or partnership efforts, that will expose me to other areas of the business. However, in all my positions the number one priority was ensuring exceptional customer experience. I enjoyed connecting with customers and community members, and sharing my knowledge of lululemon and my dedication to its culture. Passion is contagious, and I will share mine with customers and clients as I implement and develop successful processes to resolve customers' issues and advocate for customers' needs. At lululemon I was involved in complex business decisions. As a result, I appreciate flexibility, organization and teamwork. I am open to feedback at all levels, take ownership of my work, and value my colleagues. Consequently, I am proud of my accomplishments and I eagerly learn from my mistakes.
          </br>
          I recently completed General Assemblyâ€™s twelve-week full-stack web development course. The curriculum covered many programming tools, languages and processes. My greatest take-away was learning to think like a developer, both strategically and creatively. My acquired skills, including HTML/CSS and web development best practices, combined with my ability to communicate with engineers and people of varying skill levels, will allow me to create documentation that is technical yet easy to understand. I am also to learn new skills and technologies, and I want to work somewhere that recognizes that value of employee development and growth. I will combine my interpersonal and analytical skills to learn, lead, collaborate challenge, and inspire myself and others.
          </br>
          In my networks of friends, family members and colleagues I am often the "connector." I value my relationships, keep in close contact with the people in my life and always follow through with my professional and personal responsibilities. I will provide exceptional support by doing what I do best; connecting with and helping people each and every day.
        </p>
        <p id='customer'>
          Exceptional Customer Support does not always involve saying "yes". However, a direct "no" is not effective. Communication is critical: When I listen to a customer's concerns I can understand the root of the problem and find a solution that makes the customer happy and does not undermine the company's best practices. Because while the customer is not always right, the customer is never wrong, either. The solution to any problem starts with listening and managing expectations.
